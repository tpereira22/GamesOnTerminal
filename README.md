# GamesOnTerminal
Play some games on the linux terminal !

I started this project with the aim of practicing OOP with c++, solving problems and train my logic thinking in general. That's why the games are on the terminal and have no graphical interface, maybe later I'll add one, but for now I want to focus on the logical side of things.
Another goal of mine with this project is to create something that I can keep building on as time goes by, so that hopefully, I can learn something about how to build a big project that gets stuff added into it regularly as well how to write code that is readable enough so that I can comeback a few weeks or months later and still be able to implement new stuff.

These games are nothing too fancy, just a tool to learn.

For now I'm starting with a Pacman clone(which is still not done yet), but my goal is to implement a lot more games like snake, sudoku, etc...and keep on adding features to the existing games like more maps, enemys, etc...
